write a fuction `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as argument
the function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate thr targetSum using numbers from the array
you may use an element of array as many times as needed
you may assume that all input numbers are nonnegatice
